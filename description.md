### Introduction
This stone-like creature sits still in darkness, its eyes glowing in the presence of a player.
\
When active, you hear the sound of its persistent gaze, and it's careful to only make moves when you're not looking.

### Damage and attacking
Damaging the stoney bird isn't as simple as it seems, as anything but a pickaxe doesn't seem to phase it.
\
Be careful though, as staring into its eyes sends chills up your spine... you've been *petrified*!

### Variants & Drops

Dying with the petrified effect turns you into a statue!
\
The statue contains all of your items and xp on death, and destroying it will drop them back on the ground

### Obtaining
Currently, the petrified effect is given by staring at the strow, but it will be brewable in the future üëÄ

## Future Goals
